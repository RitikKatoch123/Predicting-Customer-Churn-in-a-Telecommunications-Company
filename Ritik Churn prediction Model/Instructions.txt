###  Creating the flask API

```
app = Flask("__name__")
```

The loadPage method calls our home.html.
```
@app.route("/")
def loadPage():
	return render_template('home.html', query="")
```

The predict method is our POST method, which is basically called when we pass all the inputs from our front end and click SUBMIT.
```
@app.route("/", methods=['POST'])
def predict():
```
  
The run() method of Flask class runs the application on the local development server.
```
app.run()
```
